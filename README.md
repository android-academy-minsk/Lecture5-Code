# Lecture5-Code
Code sample from Lecture5 about "Networking"


This is a demo app to perform network calls in Android, as taught on Session 5 on Android Academy's Fundamentals course on session 5. Slides can be found here: https://goo.gl/Qr7gg6

To run this project and perform the network calls, you first need to get from Foursquare (the api we used) a Client Id and a Client Secret. Obtain your keys here: https://developer.foursquare.com/ Then copy and paste them in StaticParams.java

Note: During class we were focused on the commands that perform the actions we wanted. In this project, check out how are the classes and repositories organized, to help you achieve a cleaner code. We'll discuss that later during the course.
